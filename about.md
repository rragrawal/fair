The **FAIR** workshop, an initiative of the CS department at the University of Birmingham Dubai, aims at instigating a series of discussions around Artificial Intelligence research pertinent to the real-world and the UAE landscape. 

**What is AI?**
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

**How does AI work?**

As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular. 

**AI research in UAE**

Few lines about AI research relevant to the region. Opportunities and challenges. For instance, we could face the following challenges when developing AI models that are practically relevant for local applications: 

* not being robust to bias in the data
* not generalizing across different use contexts (say government, education, healthcare)
* not being scalable to industrial scale datasets. 

Moreover, the **interdisciplinary nature** of Aritificial Intelligence research presents a challenge for researchers entering the field, who need to develop expertise in mathematical, algorithmic, domain-specific knowledge and perceptual areas, plus generic skills such as software development, data management, innovation, collaboration, understanding industry needs, and reproducible research. 

To meet this need, and to **initiate a series of discussions around AI in Dubai**, we bring together AI experts a wide range of industrial and academic stakeholders in our  **Fostering AI Research workshop**, in order to contribute to AIâ€™s leading role in this field of scientific innovation, and accelerate the impact of AI in Dubai, be it in industry or academia.

**FAIR** brings together [experts from various institutions](/people), and presents invited talks given by these experts on a myriad of topics relevant to real-world AI and its applications. The details of these talks are available [here](/people).  We are happy to involve all our stakeholders and hope that this event will successfully foster AI research, both in Dubai, and thereby internationally.
