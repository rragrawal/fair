The **FAIR** workshop, an initiative of the CS department at the University of Birmingham Dubai, aims at instigating a series of discussions around Artificial Intelligence research pertinent to the real-world and the UAE landscape. 

**What is AI?**
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

The **interdisciplinary nature** of Aritificial Intelligence research presents a challenge for researchers entering the field, who need to develop expertise in mathematical, algorithmic, domain-specific knowledge and perceptual areas, plus generic skills such as software development, data management, innovation, collaboration, understanding industry needs, and reproducible research. 

To meet this need, and to **initiate a series of discussions around AI in UAE**, we bring together AI experts a wide range of industrial and academic stakeholders in our  **Fostering AI Research workshop**, in order to contribute to AIâ€™s leading role in this field of scientific innovation, and accelerate the impact of AI in the UAE, be it in industry or academia.

**FAIR** brings together experts from various eminent institutions in the UAE and internationally, and presents invited researc talks given by these experts on a myriad of topics relevant to real-world AI and its applications. These talks will be followed by a panel discussion on practical AI, followed by an invite-only session (CFAIR UAE 2023) over light refreshments and drinks on UAE-specific AI Research. 

The workshop programme is available [here](/fair/programme).  We are happy to involve all our stakeholders and hope that this event will successfully foster AI research, both in the UAE, and thereby internationally.
